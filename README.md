Escape The Rabbit Holeâ€™s primary goal is to help users diversify their opinions, open themselves up to various perspectives, and begin to understand others. Our web application takes the title or an excerpt from an article and uses a keyword extraction machine learning algorithm to determine the most relevant keywords. From there, the keywords are input into the Google Custom Search JSON API to find related articles from trusted, hand-picked news sources from across the political spectrum.
